# Diabetes Data Analysis 🎯📊🩺

## Problem Statement 🏥📉📋
The healthcare organization aims to analyze diabetes patient data to gain valuable insights into health metrics, treatment outcomes, and patient demographics.

## Objective 🎯🔍📊
The objective of this project is to analyze diabetes patient data to extract meaningful insights regarding:
- Health metrics
- Treatment outcomes
- Patient demographics

## Tasks Performed 📝📊📈

### 1. Data Analysis

- **Analyze the distribution of patients across different age groups.**
- **Identify the average glucose level for positive and negative patients** (i.e., using the 'Outcome' column).
- **Calculate the total number of patients with high blood pressure** (BP > 80).
- **Find the top 10 patients with the highest BMI.**
- **Determine the average age of patients with diabetes.**
- **Analyze the number of patients who have undergone treatment and their outcomes.**
- **Count patients with diabetes-related complications** (DiabetesPedigreeFunction > 0.5).
- **Compute the average insulin level for patients with and without diabetes.**
- **Classify and analyze the distribution of patients based on BMI categories** (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, obese).

### 2. Dashboard Creation in Power BI 📊💻📉

A Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize the findings using the following components:
- **A bar chart** showing the number of patients in each age group.
- **A pie chart** illustrating the distribution of positive and negative patients.
- **A pivot table** summarizing the number of patients with and without diabetes for each age group.
- **A table** displaying the average glucose level for patients with and without diabetes.
- **Conditional formatting** to highlight patients with high blood pressure in the dataset.
- **A slicer** to filter the data by BMI categories.

## Dataset 📂📑📊
The dataset used for this analysis contains patient records with various health indicators, including age, blood pressure, glucose levels, BMI, insulin levels, and diabetes status (Outcome: 0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic).

## Tools & Technologies Used 🛠️💾📊
- **Power BI** for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel** for data preprocessing and summary calculations.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for custom calculations in Power BI.

## How to Use This Project 🖥️📂📊
1. Open the **Diabetes Data Analysis.pbix** file in Power BI.
2. Load the dataset (**Copy of Diabetes (1).xlsx**) if not already loaded.
3. Explore the dashboard to interact with visualizations and gain insights.
4. Use the slicers and filters to analyze specific subsets of the data.

## Conclusion 🏆📊🔬
This analysis provides valuable insights into diabetes patient demographics, health conditions, and treatment outcomes. It enables healthcare professionals to better understand trends and improve decision-making for diabetes management.
